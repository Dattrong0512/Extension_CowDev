# Complete Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed (All 3 Critical Bugs)

### 1. âœ… StreetName Field Missing
**Problem**: StreetName field was not being filled in the form

**Solution**:
- Added `streetName` field to `utils.js` data generation
- Added field selector `#textarea-field-StreetName` to `content.js`
- Default value: "Main Street"

**Files Modified**:
- `utils.js` - Added streetName to generateRandomData()
- `content.js` - Added safeSetValue for StreetName field

### 2. âœ… Checkbox "Run A Test Transaction" Not Being Checked
**Problem**: Checkbox was not being checked before clicking Verify button

**Root Cause**: Setting `checked = true` THEN calling `click()` caused a double-toggle (checked â†’ unchecked)

**Solution**:
- Removed `testTransactionCheckbox.checked = true` line
- Only call `.click()` which properly toggles the checkbox
- Keep the `change` event dispatch for compatibility
- Added console log to show final checked state

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (wrong):
testTransactionCheckbox.checked = true;
testTransactionCheckbox.click(); // This toggles it back!

// AFTER (correct):
testTransactionCheckbox.click(); // Just click once
testTransactionCheckbox.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', { bubbles: true }));
```

### 3. âœ… Debug Accordions Not Expanding
**Problem**: "Human Readable" and "Debug Raw Datasource Responses" accordions remained collapsed after debug lookup

**Solution**:
- Added retry mechanism (3 retries with 1-second intervals)
- Fixed text matching for "Debug Raw Datasource Response" (without 's' at end)
- Added more accordion selectors including `h3.ui-accordion-header`
- Simplified click logic (removed extra event dispatching that could interfere)
- Better logging for debugging

**Key Improvements**:
1. Retry logic if accordions not found initially (page still loading)
2. 1-second wait before each attempt
3. Cleaner click logic (just `.click()` without extra events)
4. Better error messages showing what was found
