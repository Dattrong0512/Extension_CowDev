# DevCow Extension - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Country Selection Not Working
**Problem**: The extension wasn't properly selecting countries from the country picker modal.

**Root Causes**:
- Incorrect selector assumptions
- Not finding the Change Country button
- Not properly clicking radio buttons in the country list
- Insufficient wait time after country selection

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Multiple selector fallbacks** for the Change Country button:
  - Try `.change-country-button` class first
  - Fall back to searching all buttons by text content ("Change Country")
  
- ✅ **Robust country selection logic**:
  - Find all `<label>` elements in the country picker
  - Match label text with selected country (exact match or includes)
  - Find associated radio button (inside label or as sibling)
  - Click radio button AND trigger change/click events
  - Increased wait time to 2 seconds for modal to close
  
- ✅ **Additional wait after country change**:
  - Added 2-second wait after country selection completes
  - Allows page to fully update before filling form fields

### 2. Transaction ID Extraction Failing
**Problem**: Extension couldn't find the transaction ID after form submission.

**Root Causes**:
- Transaction ID is in a hidden input field, not visible text
- Previous selectors were too generic
- Not checking input field values

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Method 1 - Input field search** (Primary):
  - Look for `input[name*="TransactionRecordID"]`
  - Look for `input[id*="TransactionRecordID"]`
  - Look for variations with "TransactionId"
  - Extract the `.value` property from the input
  
- ✅ **Method 2 - Text pattern matching** (Fallback):
  - Search page text for "Transaction ID: [value]"
  - Search for "Record ID: [value]"
  - Search for "GUID: [value]"
  
- ✅ **Method 3 - Element attributes** (Last resort):
  - Check for `data-transaction` attributes
  - Look for elements with transaction-related classes/IDs

### 3. Debug Lookup Not Working
**Problem**: Transaction ID wasn't being pasted into the debug page lookup field.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Multiple input field selectors**:
  - Try `.text-box.single-line` first
  - Fall back to `input[name*="TransactionRecordID"]`
  - Try any `input[type="text"]` as last resort
  
- ✅ **Enhanced event triggering**:
  - Fire `input` event
  - Fire `change` event  
  - Fire `keyup` event
  - Ensures reactive forms detect the value
  
- ✅ **Improved button finding**:
  - Try `input[type="submit"][value="Lookup"]`
  - Fall back to any `button[type="submit"]`
  - Try buttons with class `.lookup`
  - Increased delay before clicking (800ms)
  
- ✅ **Debug logging**:
  - Logs all buttons found if lookup button missing
  - Logs all text inputs found if input field missing
  - Helps troubleshoot page structure issues

## Testing Checklist

When testing the extension, verify:

- [ ] Country picker opens when button is clicked
- [ ] Correct country (Netherlands/Portugal) is selected
- [ ] Country selection modal closes automatically
- [ ] Page updates with selected country
- [ ] Form fields are filled correctly
- [ ] Test case value appears in the tested field
- [ ] Form submits successfully
- [ ] Transaction ID is captured
- [ ] Debug page opens after 10 seconds
- [ ] Transaction ID is pasted into debug field
- [ ] Lookup button is clicked automatically

## Console Log Output

Expected console messages:
```
========== TEST CASE 1 ==========
Country: Netherlands
Field to test: EmailAddress
Test value: test@example.com
Step 1: Selecting country...
Clicking change country button...
Country picker opened
Found 15 options in country picker
Checking option: "Brazil"
Checking option: "Netherlands"
Found matching country: Netherlands
Clicking radio button for country
Country selection completed
Waiting for page to update after country change...
Step 2: Generating random data...
Form filled with data: {...}
Clicking submit button...
Transaction ID found in input field: ABC123XYZ
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Country picker structure**: Code assumes labels contain radio buttons or have them as siblings
2. **Page load timing**: Uses fixed delays (may need adjustment for slow connections)
3. **Transaction ID format**: Assumes alphanumeric format with possible hyphens
4. **Debug page structure**: Assumes standard Trulioo debug interface

## Troubleshooting Tips

If country selection still fails:
1. Check browser console for detailed logs
2. Verify the Change Country button selector
3. Inspect the country picker HTML structure
4. Ensure radio buttons are properly associated with labels

If transaction extraction fails:
1. Check if transaction ID appears on success page
2. Inspect the input field names/IDs
3. Look for the actual transaction ID format
4. Verify page navigation completes successfully
